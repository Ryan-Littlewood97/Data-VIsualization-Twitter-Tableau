# Datathon-1-
This project was done for Data Visualization 624 at the University of Calgary. This project was done to assess sedentary behaviours of Canadians. This was done by using public
twitter data, and various data science applications to analyze the data. These applications were NLP, Supervised and Unseupervised machine learning, and data visualization tactics
to explore the dataset. Insights were drawn on how Canaidians live their lives, and what we can tell by analyzing social media data. Enjoy!
